# -- If you like to test, probably need to clean up
# -- the ### is the first 3 alpha/num of the item (container or image)
#
# docker container ls

#
# -- IN GIT BASH: Start the docker magic
# -- note the period. That's key magic
# docker build --tag=gcanalytics .
#
# -- note the /tcp, That's key magic
